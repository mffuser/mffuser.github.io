"The Carpentries" is an organization that is dedicated to improving
coding and data science skills of researchers worldwide. Besides the
numerous workshops that they offer worldwide, they also provide plenty
of learning material publicly available on their webpage. An overview
of lessons with slightly different target audiences can be found on
the following pages:

<br>

- [https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/)
- [https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
- [https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/)

The tutorials are meant to give you a short introduction of multiple
really awesome tools that will definitely change your daily workflow
for the better. In particular, I highly recommend the following
lessons: 

<br>

- [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice)
- Python, Matlab or R lessons (depending on your taste)
- [Using Databases and SQL](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey)
- [Automation and Make](http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice)
- [Webscraping](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-webscraping/)


You should also check their [reading
list](https://software-carpentry.org/reading/). I still remember
reading [Best Practices for Scientific
Computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)
of Greg Wilson in the early days of my position at university. It
truly shaped my thinking about coding and software tools - I highly
recommend it! I can only assume that [A Quick Introduction to Version
Control with Git and
GitHub](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004668)
is similarly worth reading for anyone not yet familiar with *git*.
