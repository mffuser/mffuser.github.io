Hi, I'm Chris. Welcome to my blog.


### About Quant Perspective

We all know the famous saying: "Through experience we learn". In my
view, rigorous quantitative thinking is just a way to exploit this to
the fullest. Two important aspects associated with a quantitative
approach seem particularly well-suited to create some added value.
First, there is no reason why we should learn from our own experiences
only. Instead of smoking ourselves for 20 years in order to find out
about the adverse long-term effects on health we just might look at
the experiences of other people that already have carried out this
unfortunate experiment on their own. In other words: we can simply
rely on a broader database, filled with experiences from multiple
persons, instead of only relying on things that we have experienced
ourselves. And second, quantitative thinking also might improve the
efficiency of learning from any given experience. Overestimation,
overconfidence, biases - there are many human traits that can get in
the way of objective evaluations and hence inhibit optimal decision
making. Using a rigorous quantitative modeling approach reduces these
deficiencies and puts decision making into a testable and verifiable
framework - a prerequisite to evaluate success. With the right tools,
data can reveals insights that go far beyond the history and
experiences of any single person.

<br>

More concretely, the following components are essential to a
quantitative approach:

<br>

- **Quantification**: Instead of talking about "nice" or "hot"
  weather, it is much more precise to compare days in terms of
  objective measures like temperature or humidity.
- **Data**: data enables us to learn from past events. But course,
  "with great power comes great responsibility" - we need to be very
  cautious about how we use, store and interpret data.
- **Models**: TODO assumptions and inferences.
- **Visualizations**: A picture is worth a thousand words. In many
  situations well-suited visualizations will be the easiest and
  fastest way to discover patterns in data, summarize findings and
  convey a certain finding to other people.


### About Me

My enthusiasm for statistical modeling goes back many years. I
graduated in financial mathematics before I became a research
assistant at the statistics department of Ludwig-Maximilians
University (LMU). During that time I was involved in several research
projects, for instance modeling of market risk, fixed-income
securities, options, commodities, variable annuities and failure rates
of wind parks. Primarily, however, I did engage in "Dynamic Risk
Management of Multi-asset Portfolios", the topic of my doctoral thesis
which I wrote at the chair of financial econometrics.

<br>

My goal has always been to achieve a holistic view on financial
markets, and to build a strong understanding about statistical
methodologies. I am convinced that the best way of getting there is
through active engagement with real world data, using state of the art
software tools.

<br>

This is what I am passionate about, and also what I am working on. At
Scalable Capital I am Head of Quantitative Investment Strategy and
part of a team that develops algorithms that automatically monitor and
actively re-balance client portfolios with regards to aspects of risk.
