Hi, I'm Chris. Welcome to my blog.


## About Quant Perspective

Through experience we learn, and quantitative data analysis is a way
to exploit this to the fullest. Overestimation, overconfidence, bias -
there are many human traits that can get in the way of optimal
decision making. Using a rigorous quantitative modeling approach
reduces these deficiencies and puts decision making into a testable
and verifiable framework - a prerequisite to evaluate success. In such
a quantitative environment data can optimally be put to use. With the
right tools, data reveals insights that go far beyond the history and
experiences of a single person.


## About Me

My enthusiasm for financial modeling goes back many years. I graduated
in financial mathematics before I became a research assistant at the
statistics department of Ludwig-Maximilians University (LMU). During
that time I was involved in several research projects, for instance
modeling of market risk, fixed-income securities, options,
commodities, variable annuities and failure rates of wind parks.
Primarily, however, I did engage in "Dynamic Risk Management of
Multi-asset Portfolios", the topic of my doctoral thesis which I wrote
at the chair of financial econometrics.


My goal has always been to achieve a holistic view on financial
markets, and to build a strong understanding about statistical
methodologies. I am convinced that the best way of getting there is
through active engagement with real world data, using state of the art
software tools.


This is what I am passionate about, and also what I am working on. At
Scalable Capital I am Head of Quantitative Investment Strategy and
part of a team that develops the algorithm that automatically monitors
and actively re-balances client portfolios with regards to aspects of
risk.
